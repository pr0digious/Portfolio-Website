    <h3>Hello everyone!</h3>

    <section>
    <p>
        Welcome to my digital space! I am Joseph, a passionate and ambitious Computer Science major with a penchant for innovation and problem-solving. 
        As a student, I have immersed myself in the dynamic world of computer science, honing my skills in programming and front-end development. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my time in college, I have spent my time refining my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python creating developing small projects to help develop my understanding of syntax use.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I move forward with time, my short term goal is to hone my skills into web development to create interactive websites for people and organizations to aid their everyday productivity. 
        In addition, while I enjoy the design aspect of web development, one motto I follow is "function over form" to ensure that performance is efficient and viable.
    <p>
        This portfolio serves as a showcase of my journey, featuring a diverse range of projects that reflect my dedication to mastering the latest technologies and creating solutions that make a meaningful impact. 
        Join me on this exploration of code, creativity, and the limitless possibilities that the world of computer science has to offer.
    </p>
